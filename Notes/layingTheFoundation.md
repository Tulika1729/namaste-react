# JSX in React

React can also be built without JSX. JSX is not a fundamental part of React, but it greatly enhances code readability and developer-friendliness.

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows the merging of HTML and JavaScript in a seamless way. It is not HTML embedded inside JavaScript; rather, it is an HTML-like syntax that simplifies the creation of React elements.

For example, consider the following JSX code:

```jsx
const jsxHeading = <h1>Namaste React</h1>;
