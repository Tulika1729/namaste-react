1st way to get react in project - via CDN
Content Delivery Networks where react is hosted and we pull react from it

What is CDN?
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content, such as text, images, scripts, videos, and other resources, to users based on their geographic locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to improve the performance, availability, and scalability of web services and websites. Here's how CDN works and its key benefits:

How CDN Works:

    Content Distribution: CDNs have a network of servers strategically located in various geographic regions. These servers are often referred to as "edge servers" or "points of presence" (PoPs).

    Caching: When a user requests a web resource, such as an image or a video, the CDN automatically determines the user's geographic location and serves the content from the nearest edge server rather than the origin server where the website is hosted.

    Load Balancing: CDNs use load balancing algorithms to distribute incoming requests among multiple edge servers. This ensures that no single server becomes overwhelmed with traffic and improves the overall speed and responsiveness of the website.

    Reduced Latency: By serving content from nearby servers, CDNs reduce the physical distance between the user and the server, significantly decreasing latency and improving page load times.

    Content Optimization: CDNs often provide features for optimizing content delivery, such as image compression, script minification, and content compression. These optimizations further enhance website performance.

Key Benefits of CDN:

    Faster Loading Times: CDNs accelerate the delivery of web content, leading to faster page load times. This improved speed enhances user experience and reduces bounce rates.

    Improved Website Availability: CDNs can cache and serve web content even if the origin server experiences downtime or is unreachable. This ensures that websites remain accessible to users.

    Scalability: CDNs can handle increased traffic and sudden spikes in demand, making them suitable for websites with varying levels of traffic.

    Global Reach: CDNs have a global network presence, allowing websites to serve content to users worldwide with consistent performance.

    Reduced Server Load: CDNs offload traffic from the origin server, reducing the load on the server and improving its responsiveness.

    Security: Many CDNs offer security features, such as DDoS protection and web application firewalls, to mitigate cyber threats and attacks.

    Bandwidth Savings: CDNs can save bandwidth costs for website owners because they handle a significant portion of the content delivery.

    Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly. Website owners and businesses often integrate CDNs into their infrastructure to ensure a better online experience for their users and to enhance the performance and availability of their web services.
